* **Kali**: The standard distribution with all tools and the current Gnome desktop. There is a choice of 32- or 64-bit versions. This version is installed completely from scratch and requires at least 768 MByte RAM, 2 GByte are recommended.
* **Kali Light**: Those with little space or less powerful resources can go for Kali Light. This uses the XFCE desktop and contains significantly fewer tools. However, these can all be installed later â€“ in this respect, the distribution is great for building your own toolbox. Kali Light is available in a 32 and 64 bit version.
* **Different desktops**: Kali e17, Kali Mate, Kali XFce and Kali LXDE are all variants of the standard Kali installation, whereby different desktops are used in each case. They are only available as 64-bit versions.
* **Kali Armhf and Armel**: These versions are generally intended for ARM-based devices. However, where possible you should use the special distributions listed on this page. For example, there are ready-made images for Chromebooks or Raspberry Pis.
* **Virtual images**: Perfect to use Kali in parallel. The standard version is available in ready-made images for VMware, VirtualBox and HyperV. Just download, mount, launch and use.
* **NetHunter**: For mobile devices, there is the Nethunter variant. Due to the different chipsets and various restrictions of mobile systems, only various Nexus devices and the OnePlus One Phone are officially supported.
* **LSS**: Since January, there is another alternative for the really brave: Kali Linux for the Windows Subsystem for Linux. That means you can use Kali directly from Windows 10.
* **Special case cloud installation**: In addition to local installations, Kali can also be installed on a cloud system. This can have advantages (for example, to quickly offer the systems to several users in a private cloud), but potentially there are also problems. These include, for example, the regulations of providers as to whether such systems are permitted at all.

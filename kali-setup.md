# Kali Setup

In Workstation\
Click 'Create a New Virtual Machine'.\
Click 'Installer disc image radio button, and load the iso.\
Rename your machine.\
Click Next.\
20 GB is sufficient, unless you chose the full fat kali, then 40 GB.\
Increase memory to 2GB, but 4GB if you have more RAM.

I also like to set for 4 cpu's, that 2 phsical and 2 virtual.

Follow prompts and install Kali.

Kali is setup the same for everyone, and being as we're running it in a vmware this isn't so much of a problem but as a good exercise (especially if you're ever going to run it bare metal), I always harden Kali.
